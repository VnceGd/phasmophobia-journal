# Phasmophobia Journal

https://vncegd.github.io/phasmophobia-journal

Web version of the Phasmophobia journal's evidence and ghost pages

### Motivation

Sometimes you die before confirming the ghost type, and want to figure out which evidence(s) or secondary evidence you were missing. Since the journal is not accessible from the lobby, you would need to start a new case or refer to an external tool to do so.

### Considerations

While similar web apps exist, this one aims to match the look and feel of the in-game journal so  you can spend less time learning how to use a new interface.

As a result, this app is less mobile-friendly and thus not recommended for players who wish to have their external tool of choice open on a mobile device.

## Features

_Note: JavaScript must be enabled for full functionality._
 
This app contains the same features as the in-game journal for the ghost types page, evidence page, and each ghost page:

* Select and eliminate evidence to narrow down the possibilities for the ghost type
* Jump to a ghost page from the Ghost Types list or flip back and forth to read the description, strength, weakness, and evidence corresponding with each ghost

## Scope

Addition of the introductory pages of the journal is a low priority, and the Overview and Photos sections cannot be implemented for the web as they are tied to the game session.

Addition of static or interactive maps is a low priority, as there exist apps that have these implemented.

Addition of support for multiple languages is currently the next highest priority as the effort is more feasible, although it may take a considerable amount of time.
